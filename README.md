# Stanford-Algorithms-Specialization
This specialization is an introduction to data structures and algorithms. It emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details. Taught by [Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768), and provided and available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

## Introduction
This repository contains solutions to the assignments of Stanford Algorithms Specialization. Please attempt the assignments on your own first. You can always consult the discussion forum for hints or explanations. I found it super helpful on my learning journey. Use this as a reference only. 

And in no way is this course even close to a real-world implementation when it comes to programming. Additional learning resources are highly suggested.

I would still encourage those who successfully tackled the problems to look at other people's solutions in that everyone's brain works differently. Sometimes different approaches may spark some ideas or probably inspire you in the long run. And then you can incorporate those ideas into your programming toolbox.

Happy coding:smiley:
